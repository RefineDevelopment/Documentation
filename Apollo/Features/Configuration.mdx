### damage_settings

Configure damage given to players when they are lagged back for cheating

### ghost_block_settings

Configure the ghost block lagbacks. Do not disable this unless you want crazy bypasses.

If you end up with players being incorrectly teleported out of arenas or similar, then consider modifying this.

### resend_teleports

- **Type:** `String`
- **Description:** This has a good comment, but in summary, it lets you configure how teleports are resent. It is recommended to set this to TICKS for smooth setbacks, and to PING to not send many extra teleports.

### send_extra_packet

- **Type:** `Boolean`
- **Description:** Send an extra packet to prevent false flags? It is not recommended to disable this.
