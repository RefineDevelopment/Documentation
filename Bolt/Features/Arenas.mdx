## Arena Setup Guide

**NOTE**: If your arenas are bigger than 300x300, go into settings.yml and increase the grid size from 300 to your desired amount. This is the distance between each arena. I recommend doing this BEFORE you make arenas to prevent them pasting into each other.

## For 1.12+ ABOVE

**NOTE**: Standalone and Standard arena are both combined on versions above 1.12+ since Bolt 1.5, so you do not need to specify an arena type when creating one.

## Setting up a default arena for 1.8-1.12

# How do we setup default arena?
1. Paste a schematic from WorldEdt
2. Do /edit to go into build mode.
3. Do /arena create <name> <type>. (Arena types are two, standard and stand alone)
- Standard arenas are shared, and no build fights can take place here. (You can't duplicate these)
- Standalone arenas are build arenas, only fight can be taken here at a time. (You can duplicate these)
4. Set the spawns:
- Spawn 1 place a fence and a Player Head on top of it.
- Spawn 2 place a fence and a Player Head on top of it.
5. Use the arena wand given in your first slot to select bounds, make sure you select the entire arena as Bolt's Arena System will paste it according to a grid.
6. Click in chat where it says **CLICK HERE** OR do `/arena finish`.
7. You can now add kits to your arena using `/arena addkit <arena>`.
8. If your arena is standalone you can now duplicate it using `/arena scale <amountOfCopies>` or `/arena manage`.

# How do we setup Bridge arena?
1. Paste a schematic from World Edit in the **Arena World**.
2. Do `/edit` to go into build mode.
3. Do `/arena create <name>` standalone.
4. Set the spawns 
- Blue Spawn place a Blue Wool and a Player Head on it.
- Red Spawn place a Red Wool and a Player Head on it.
5. Use the arena wand given in your first slot to select bounds, make sure you select the entire arena as Bolt's Arena System will paste it according to a grid.
6. Click in chat where it says CLICK HERE OR do `/arena finish`.
7. Now go to the arena using `/arena tp <arena>`.
8. Select cuboid for portals using `/arena wand` and set them using `/arena setSpecialCuboid <arena> <red/blue>`. (Do this step if your experiencing issues with portals)
9. You can now add kits to your arena using `/arena addkit <arena>`.
10. You can now also duplicate it using `/arena scale <amountOfCopies>` or `/arena manage`.
    
# How do we setup a Bed-based arena?
1. Paste a schematic from World Edit in the **Arena World**.
2. Do `/edit` to go into build mode.
3. Do `/arena create <name>` standalone.
4. Set the spawns 
- Blue Spawn place a Blue Wool and a Player Head on it.
- Red Spawn place a Red Wool and a Player Head on it.
5. For special locations like beds and portals, this is how to set them.
- Bolt detects special points using a **focal point** or **mid point**
- Find the closest block you can find to the bed, place Red or Blue wool depending on team color, now on top of it, place a sponge.
6. Use the arena wand given in your first slot to select bounds, make sure you select the entire arena as Bolt's Arena System will paste it according to a grid.
7. Click in chat where it says CLICK HERE OR do `/arena finish`.
8. You can now add kits to your arena using `/arena addkit <arena>`.
9. You can now also duplicate it using `/arena scale <amountOfCopies>` or `/arena manage`.

## Setting up a default arena for 1.13-LATEST

Setting up an arena in the latest version is the same process however, all arenas are created in standalone mode, meaning they have to be duplicated.

# How do we setup default arena?
1. Paste a schematic from WorldEdt
2. Do /edit to go into build mode.
3. Do /arena create <name> standalone

# For normal arenas, e.g NoDebuff, Boxing
4. Set the spawns:
- Spawn 1 place a fence and a Player Head on top of it.
- Spawn 2 place a fence and a Player Head on top of it.

# For Beds and Portals (Skip this if your just setting a normal arena)
5. For special locations like beds and portals, this is how to set them.
- Bolt detects special points using a **focal point** or **mid point**
- Find the closest block you can find to the bed, place Red or Blue wool depending on team color, now on top of it, place a sponge.

6. Use the arena wand given in your first slot to select bounds, make sure you select the entire arena as Bolt's Arena System will paste it according to a grid.
7. Click in chat where it says **CLICK HERE** OR do `/arena finish`.

# Do this step if your having issues with portals not working properly.
8. Select cuboid for portals using `/arena wand` and set them using `/arena setSpecialCuboid <arena> <red/blue>`.

9. You can now add kits to your arena using `/arena addkit <arena>`.
10. You can now also duplicate it using `/arena scale <amountOfCopies>` or `/arena manage`.
