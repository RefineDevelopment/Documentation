## FAQ

<details>
<summary>My server runs out of ram on startup.</summary>

It is recommended to allocate as much memory you can to the server
in accordance with the amount of chunks/arenas you have.

Alternatively, you can disable `PRE-LOAD-CHUNKS` in your `settings.yml`. If you are using 'CHUNK' or 'VANLLA'
reset type, then turn on 'CLEAR-CHUNK-DATA-AFTER-RESET' to reduce memory usage.
