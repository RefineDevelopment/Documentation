## FAQ

<details>
<summary>My menus are not working on 1.12+ servers. How do I fix?</summary>

Change `fill-glass` in `menus.yml` to something like `GRAY_STAINED_GLASS_PANE`, then restart.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why can’t I grant a rank even when I'm OP?</summary>

Please ensure you have `core.grant.*` or `core.grant.<rank>`, and your rank is above the rank you're trying to grant.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why am I being blacklisted randomly when I op someone or I get opped?</summary>

This is because you aren't a [security user](/Phoenix/Features/Security).
Execute `/security add <player> [admin]` in console to fix this.

It is highly recommended to keep security enabled to prevent unauthorized administrative actions.
